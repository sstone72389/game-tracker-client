Purpose of app: A video gaming journal, allowing users to make posts and track the progress of their gameplay.

This project is a single page application containing user authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out and change password) that interacts with a custom API built with Rails. This app can create, read, update, and delete data in an SQL database to create a gaming journal.

Approach taken when building: Planning was key, here. I started by creating wireframes and user stories. The next step for me was to build a basic HTML/CSS template that will provide a responsive user experience. From there, the next step was to build the back-end so and test via CURL scripts to ensure functionality.

Once confirmed, I was able to move to the front end and create proper client interactions to access the database. Future iterations of this project will contain the ability to use YouTube to tie videos to posts.

User Stories:
* As a user, I want to be able to login/signup
* As a user, I want to be able to change my password
* As a user, I want to be able to sign out
* As a user, I want to be able to make posts
* As a user, I want to be able to delete my posts
* As a user, I want to be able to modify my posts

Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, JSON, AJAX, Git, GitHub, Grunt, Rails, Sass, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Rails Console, Node console(testing), Pry(testing).

Unsolved problems: I intend for this app to eventually support the ability to upload videos via youtube. The original purpose for this game-tracker was to upload videos along with posts to help manage games that have large maps. For example, you could take notes on where to find a secret item and upload a video to go with your post.

Here are wrieframes for the eventual end-product:
